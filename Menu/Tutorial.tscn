Final Sector is a deckbuilder / tower-defense hybrid.  

Enemies will come to destroy your CORE in waves. Place TOWERS and Issue COMMANDS to stop them! 

You discard your hand and draw 5 new cards at the end of every wave. Survive waves to add new cards to your deck!

Placing TOWERS and Issuing COMMANDS Costs ENERGY. Your ENERGY Starts at 3 Every Wave.

Controls:
Left-Click on a card from your hand to select a card to play. Left-Click again to Place TOWER or issue COMMAND. Right-Click to Deselect.

Placing a TOWER on a TOWER of the same type will upgrade the existing TOWER

Some Towers Can be Rotated with 'R'."
